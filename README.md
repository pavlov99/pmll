## Data Format:
Data is stored in tab separated file. First line is header with field names and types. First line starts with sharp and space (# ). Then follows `label:label_type [field:type]`

Possible scale(field) types:

* nom:  nominal value represented by string
* lin:  float number in linear scale
* rank: float number, arithmetic operations are not supported
* bin:  binary format, true/false or 1/0

Example:

    # label:nom	weight:lin	heigth:lin
    0	70	180
